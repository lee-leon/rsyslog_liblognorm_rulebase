Basic syntax
============

Each line in rulebase file is evaluated separately.
Lines starting with '#' are commentaries.
Empty lines are just skipped, they can be inserted for readability.
If the line starts with 'rule=', then it contains a rule.
This line hasfollowing format:
  rule=[<tag1>[,<tag2>...]]:<match description>

Everything before a colon is treated as comma-separated list of tags, which
will be attached to a match. After the colon, match description should be
given. It consists of string literals and field selectors. String literals
should match exactly. Field selector has this format:

  %<field name>:<field type>[:<extra data>]%

Percent sign is used to enclose field selector.
If you need to match literal '%', it can be written as '%%' or '\x25'.

Behaviour of field selector depends on its type, which is decribed below.

If field name is set to '-', this field is matched but not saved.

Several rules can have a common prefix. You can set it once with this syntax:
  prefix=<prefix match description>
Every following rule will be treated as an addition to this prefix.
Prefix can be reset to default (empty value) by the line:
  prefix=

Tags of the matched rule are attached to the message and can be used to
annotate it. Annotation allows to add fixed fields to the message.
Syntax is as following:
  annotate=<tag>:+<field name>="<field value>"
Field value should always be enclosed in double quote marks.
There can be multiple annotations for the same tag.

Field types
===========
 1. %field_name:rest%
 2. %field_name:number%
 3. %field_name:word%
 4. %field_name:char-to:,%
 5. %field_name:char-to:\x25%
 6. %field_name:quoted-string%
 7. %field-name:date-iso%
 8. %field_name:time-24hr%
 9. %field_name:time-12hr%
10. %field_name:ipv4%
11. %field_name:date-rfc3164%
12. %field_name:date-rfc5424%
13. %-:iptables%

Field type:   'rest'
  Matches:    zero or more characters till end of line
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:rest%
  Notes:      should be always at end of the rule

Field type:   'number'
  Matches:    one or more decimal digits
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:number%

Field type:   'word'
  Matches:    one or more characters, up to the next space (\x20), or up to end of line
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:word%

Field type:   'char-to'
  Matches:    one or more characters, up to the next character given in extra data
  Extra data: one character (can be escaped)
  Example:    %field_name:char-to:,%
              %field_name:char-to:\x25%

Field type:   'char-sep'
  Matches:    zero or more characters, up to the next character given in extra data, or up to end of line
  Extra data: one character (can be escaped)
  Example:    %field_name:char-sep:,%
              %field_name:char-sep:\x25%

Field type:   'quoted-string'
  Matches:    zero or more characters, surrounded by double quote marks
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:quoted-string%
  Notes:      quote marks are stripped from the match

Field type:   'date-iso'
  Matches:    date of format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field-name:date-iso%

Field type:   'time-24hr'
  Matches:    time of format 'HH:MM:SS', where HH is 00..23
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:time-24hr%

Field type:   'time-12hr'
  Matches:    time of format 'HH:MM:SS', where HH is 00..12
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:time-12hr%

Field type:   'ipv4'
  Matches:    IPv4 address, in dot-decimal notation (AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD)
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:ipv4%

Field type:   'date-rfc3164'
  Matches:    valid date/time in RFC3164 format, i.e.: 'Oct 29 09:47:08'
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:date-rfc3164%
  Notes:      this parser implements several quirks to match malformed timestamps from some devices

Field type:   'date-rfc5424'
  Matches:    valid date/time in RFC5424 format, i.e.:
              '1985-04-12T19:20:50.52-04:00'
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %field_name:date-rfc5424%
  Notes:      slightly different formats are allowed

Field type:   'iptables'
  Matches:    name=value pairs, separated by spaces, as in Netfilter log messages
  Extra data: not used
  Example:    %-:iptables%
  Notes:      name of the selector is not used; names from the line are used instead
              ... this selector always matches everything till end of the line
              ... cannot match zero characters
